- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
- [ ] File upload restrictions (if applicable)
- [ ] SQL/NoSQL injection prevention

### Monitoring & Logging

## 🛠️ Security Tools & Commands

### Run Security Audit
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically
npm audit fix

# Check outdated packages
npm outdated
```

### Test Security Headers
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com

# Test CORS policy
curl -H "Origin: https://malicious-site.com" https://your-domain.com/api/posts
```

### Validate Environment
```bash
# Check environment variables
node -e "console.log(Object.keys(process.env).filter(k => k.includes('KEY')).length)"

# Test database connection
node -e "require('./server/models/Post.js')"
```

## 🚨 Security Incidents Response

### If API Keys Compromised
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Update environment variables
3. Restart application
4. Monitor for unauthorized usage
5. Review access logs

### If Database Compromised  
1. Change database credentials
2. Update connection strings
3. Review database access logs
4. Audit data integrity
5. Notify users if needed

### If Server Compromised
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence
3. Update all credentials
4. Patch vulnerabilities
5. Monitor for persistence

## 📊 Security Metrics
